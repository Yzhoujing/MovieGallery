# Movie Gallery

This is a movie searching platform with ranking-based recommendation built mainly using React and Vite. I also used DevOps and Agile in this project.

This project is currently using these two plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
